Portfolio Site

This site was made during my studies in MJII, when I was doing Electronics Engineering in Embedded Systems Diploma.
I dropped out to pursue a marketing career ,hence some of the projects showcased there is 3-5 years old.

Currently, I am building a new portfolio site. Stay tuned.
